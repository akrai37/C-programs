logical operators- &&  ||  !
comparison operators- ==  >= <=
TernaryOperator - can be used instead of if-else ,format- condition ? statement1 : statement2
WhileLoop- while(condition){statments followed by counter}
DoWhileLoop-do{statements}while(); , The differnce between dowhile and while is that in DoWhile the statement would be executed atleast once followed by the condition in the while loop . the counter could be run at the end of statements in the doWhile if it is used .
It is ended by semi-colon.
ForLoop- for(initialization ; condition ; updation ){}

arrays are collection of values of same datatype .syntax: variable[total no. of memory blocks]={values };
it is declare like dictionary in python.
while declaring the array , remember we will declare the total number of memory blocks from ONE , not zero . ex- for six blocks a[6] 
not a[5]
while extracting the values from array we will use index from ZERO , not ONE ex- marks[1] represents second element not one .
mutidimentional array represents row and column - a[0][2] is 1st row and 3rd column. syntax-{ {},{} };
functions perform specific tasks . it will either return the value or not. syntax- datatype function(){}
no semicolon at end . Also we can call the functions as many times as we want.
if function is defined after main fn , then we have to create a Prototype which is declaring fn before main with the datatype of parameters . semicolon is must for prototype.
if datatype is other than void than we have to return a value to the fn where it is called.
we can also declare values at the prototype , then we dont have to decare that specific parameter value at the CALL of fn  . this type of fn is called default fn.
